RubyGems Developers
===================

Showing off the latest and greatest projects in the RubyGems ecosystem!

Goals
=====

* Help developers get involved in RubyGems and its associated projects
* Have one place to find out where these projects are!

Setup
=====

This is a Rails 3.1 app that is deployed to Heroku. Get the app running on your box with:

    bundle
    rails server

Done! There's no database requirement (in fact, ActiveRecord is not loaded at all!) so setup should go smoothly.

Thanks
======

Huge thanks to [thoughtbot](http//thoughtbot.com) whose [playbook](http://playbook.thoughtbot.com) these styles are based off of.
