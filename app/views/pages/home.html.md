Stickler is a great way to run and organize an internal gem server in your
organization. It helps with mirroring gems and providing a gem source to add
internal/proprietary code to.

## Works in Progress

### [RubyGems Search](https://github.com/rubygems/search)

A souped-up implementation of search on RubyGems.org, using Solr. Still not
100% done yet, but hopefully will replace the search box on RubyGems.org soon!
