Looking to contribute to a RubyGems project? You've come to the right place! There's many development efforts going on right now, and any they could use your help. If you're having problems or need help with RubyGems, open up a [support request](https://help.rubygems.org)!

## Core Projects

### [RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems)

Ruby's premier packaging system. Bundled with Ruby 1.9+, any time you run
`gem` at the command line, you're using this project.

### [RubyGems.org](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org)

The Ruby community's gem hosting service. Provides a better API for accessing,
deploying, and managing gems along with clear and accessible project pages.

### [RubyGems Guides](https://github.com/rubygems/guides)

Tutorials and lessons on how RubyGems works, and how to make your own.
User-contributed guides are more than welcome and encouraged!

### [RubyGems Testers](httpss://github.com/rubygems/rubygems-test)

A community effort to document the test results for various gems,
on various machine architectures.

### [Gem Whisperer](https://github.com/rubygems/gemwhisperer)

An example of how to use [RubyGems.org's
webhooks](http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/#webhook) to listen to every gem being
pushed. Currently powers [m.rubygems.org](http://m.rubygems.org) and
[@rubygems](http://twitter.com/rubygems).

### [RubyGems.org API Library](https://github.com/rubygems/gems)

A Ruby implementation of the various API endpoints available on RubyGems.org.
If you're writing a service in Ruby to interact with gems available to the
community, check this out!

### [RubyGems Mirror](httpss://github.com/rubygems/rubygems-mirror)

An update to the old `gem mirror` command. New ideas for how to handle
mirroring going forward are being discussed [on this project's
wiki](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems-mirror/wiki/Mirroring-2.0).

## Ecosystem Projects

### [Bundler](https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler)

Bundler manages an application's dependencies through its entire life across
many machines systematically and repeatably.

### [RubyDoc.info](httpss://github.com/lsegal/rubydoc.info)

A fantastic provider of [YARD](http://yardoc.org) documentation for every
RubyGem available. Push a gem, and you get docs created instantly!
RubyGems.org links to this site and it uses [RubyGems.org's
webhooks](http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-api/#webhook) as well.

### [Stickler](httpss://github.com/copiousfreetime/stickler)

Stickler is a great way to run and organize an internal gem server in your
organization. It helps with mirroring gems and providing a gem source to add
internal/proprietary code to.

### [Geminabox](httpss://github.com/cwninja/geminabox)

Need simple RubyGem hosting? Geminabox can do that! This project provides an
easy to setup way to host RubyGems internally and allow uploading of gems
without much hassle.

## Works in Progress

### [RubyGems Search](https://github.com/rubygems/search)

A souped-up implementation of search on RubyGems.org, using Solr. Still not
100% done yet, but hopefully will replace the search box on RubyGems.org soon!

### Your idea?

We'd love for your new idea to be on this list. If you're working on a
RubyGems related project, just [fork this
